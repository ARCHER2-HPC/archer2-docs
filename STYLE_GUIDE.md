Web site style guide
=================

All images much have an Alt Text included.  If the image is purely decorative then use a blank tag i.e. `alt=""`

All hyperlinks should be descriptive text, or an image with a descriptive Alt Text, indicating where the link will take the reader.
Hyperlinks should not be "Click here", nor should they be the raw html link.

All pages should have a H1 heading - this is generally part of each page's template.  
Subsequent headings should be incremental without gaps i.e. the next level heading should be H2 not a jump to H3.

Headings should generally be written in 'Sentence case.'

[Princeton's guide to accessible web content](https://accessibility.princeton.edu/guidelines/web#accessible-content) is a very good, brief guide to Authoring accessible content.

The [WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) is very useful - Browser extensions are available for Chrome, Firefox and Edge to check pages instantly for issues.
