# Porting applications to full ARCHER2 system

Porting applications to the full ARCHER2 system has generally 
proven straightforward if they are running successfully on 
the ARCHER2 4-cabinet system. You should be able to use the 
same (or very similar) compile processes on the the full system
as you used on ARCHER2.

During testing of the ARCHER2 full system, the CSE team at EPCC
have seen that application binaries compiled on the 4-cabinet
system can usually be copied over to the full system and work
well and give good performance. However, if you run into issues
with executables taken from the 4-cabinet system on the full system
you should recompile in the first instance.

Information on compiling applications on the full system can be
found in the
[Application Development Environment](../user-guide/dev-environment.md)
section of the User and Best Practice Guide.
