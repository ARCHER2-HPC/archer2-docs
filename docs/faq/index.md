# ARCHER2 Frequently Asked Questions

This section documents some of the questions raised to the Service Desk on ARCHER2, and the advice and solutions.


## Username already in use
**Q.** I created a machine account on ARCHER2 for a training course, but now I want to use that machine username for my main ARCHER2 project, and the system will not let me, saying "that name is already in use".  How can I re-use that username.

**A.**  Send an email to the [service desk](mailto:support@archer2.ac.uk), letting us know the username and project that you set up previously, and asking for that account and any associated data to be deleted.  Once deleted, you can then re-use that username to request an account in your main ARCHER2 project.
