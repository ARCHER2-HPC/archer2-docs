# ARCHER2 data centre network upgrade: 2023

During September 2023 the data centre that houses ARCHER2 will be undergoing a 
major network upgrade.

On this page we describe the impact this will have and links to further information.

If you have any questions or concerns, please
[contact the ARCHER2 Service Desk](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/servicedesk.html).

## When will the upgrade happen and how long will it take?

### The outage dates will be:

 - Start:  Monday 18th September 2023  09:00
 - Scheduled End:  Friday 22nd September 2023

We will notify users if we are able to complete this work ahead of schedule and restore 
ARCHER2 access earlier than expected.

## What are the impacts on users from the upgrade?

### During the upgrade process

- No login access
- No access to any data on the system for users
- User jobs will continue to run during the upgrade process - we provide more information on this below
- SAFE will be available during the outage - there will be reduced functionality due to the unavailability of the connection to ARCHER2 such as resetting of passwords or new account creation. 

### Submitting new work, and running work

- With no login access, it will not be possible to submit new jobs to the queues
- Jobs will continue to run, and queued jobs will be started as usual
- Serial QoS will not be available.

We will therefore be encouraging users to submit jobs in the period prior to the work, so that
your work can continue on the system during the upgrade process.
