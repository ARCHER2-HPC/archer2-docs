# ARCHER2 Network Upgrade: 2023

During September 2023 ARCHER2 will be undergoing a Network upgrade.

On this page we describe the impact this will have and links to further information.

If you have any questions or concerns, please
[contact the ARCHER2 Service Desk](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/servicedesk.html).



## When will the upgrade happen and how long will it take?


### The outage dates will be:

 - Start:  Monday 18th September 2023  09:00
 - Scheduled End:  Friday 22nd September 2023

We will notify users if we are able to complete this work ahead of schedule.

## What are the impacts on users from the upgrade?

### During the upgrade process

 - No login access
 - No access to any data on the system
- The SAFE will be available during the outage but there will be reduced functionality due to the unavailability of the connection to ARCHER2 such as resetting of passwords or new account creation. 

### Submitting new work, and running work

- With no login access, it will not be possible to submit new jobs to the queues
- Jobs will continue to run, and queued jobs will be started as usual
- Serial QoS will not be available.

We will therefore be encouraging users to submit jobs to the queues in the period prior to the work, so that ARCHER2 can continue to run jobs during the outage.
