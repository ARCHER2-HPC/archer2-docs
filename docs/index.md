# ARCHER2 User Documentation

ARCHER2 is the next generation UK National Supercomputing Service. You
can find more information on the service and the research it supports on
the [ARCHER2 website](https://www.archer2.ac.uk).

The ARCHER2 Service is a world class advanced computing resource for UK
researchers. ARCHER2 is provided by [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/),
[EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/), [Cray (an HPE
company)](https://www.cray.com/) and the [University of
Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

## What the documentation covers

This is the documentation for the ARCHER2 service and includes:

  - [Quick Start Guide](quick-start/overview.md)
    The ARCHER2 quick start guide provides the minimum information for
    new users.

  - [ARCHER2 User and Best Practice Guide](user-guide/index.md)
    Covers all aspects of use of the ARCHER2 supercomputing service.
    This includes fundamentals (required by all users to use the system
    effectively), best practice for getting the most out of ARCHER2, and
    other advanced technical topics.

  - [Research Software](research-software/index.md)
    Information on each of the centrally-installed research software
    packages.

  - [Software Libraries](software-libraries/index.md)
    Information on the centrally-installed software libraries. Most
    libraries work *as expected* so no additional notes are required
    however a small number require specific documentation

  - [Data Analysis and Tools](data-tools/index.md)
    Information on data analysis tools and other useful utilities.

  - [Other Software](other-software/index.md)
    Useful information on software that is not officially supported by the 
    ARCHER2 service but that will be useful to users of that software.

  - [Essential Skills](essentials/index.md)
    This section provides information and links on essential skills
    required to use ARCHER2 efficiently: *e.g.* using Linux command
    line, accessing help and documentation.

  - [ARCHER2 and publications](publish/index.md)
    This section describes how to acknowledge the use of ARCHER2 in
    your published work and how to use the ARCHER2 publications 
    database.
