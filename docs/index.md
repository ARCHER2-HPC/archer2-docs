# ARCHER2 User Documentation

!!! warning
    The ARCHER2 Service is not yet available. This documentation is in
    development. ARCHER2 is due to commence operation in 2020, replacing the
    current service ARCHER. For more information on ARCHER, please visit the
    [ARCHER web site](http://www.archer.ac.uk).


ARCHER2 is the next generation UK National Supercomputing Service. You
can find more information on the service and the research it supports on
the [ARCHER2 website](https://www.archer2.ac.uk).

The ARCHER2 Service is a world class advanced computing resource for UK
researchers. ARCHER2 is provided by [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/),
[EPCC](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/), [Cray (an HPE
company)](https://www.cray.com/) and the [University of
Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

## What the documentation covers

This is the documentation for the ARCHER2 service and includes:

  - [Quick Start Guide](quick-start/)
    The ARCHER2 quick start guide provides the minimum information for
    new users or users transferring from ARCHER.

  - [ARCHER2 User and Best Practice Guide](user-guide/)
    Covers all aspects of use of the ARCHER2 supercomputing service.
    This includes fundamentals (required by all users to use the system
    effectively), best practice for getting the most out of ARCHER2, and
    more advanced technical topics.

  - [Research Software](research-software/)
    Information on each of the centrally-installed research software
    packages.

  - [Software Libraries](software-libraries/)
    Information on the centrally-installed software libraries. Most
    libraries work *as expected* so no additional notes are required
    however a small number require specific documentation

  - [Data Analysis and Tools](data-tools/)
    Information on data analysis tools and other useful utilities.

  - [Essential Skills](essentials/)
    This section provides information and links on essential skills
    required to use ARCHER2 efficiently: *e.g.* using Linux command
    line, accessing help and documentation.
