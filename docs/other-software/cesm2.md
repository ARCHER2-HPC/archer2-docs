# Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 2.1.3

CESM is a fully-coupled, community, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states. At the time of writing, CESM 2.1.3 is the latest scientifically verified version of the model.

Due to the nature of CESM2, there is not a centrally installed version of the program available on Archer2. Instead, users download their own copy of the program and make use of Archer2-specific configurations that have been rigorously tested.

## Setting up CESM 2.1.3 on Archer2

Due to the nature of CESM2, there is not a centrally installed version of the program available on Archer2. Instead, users download their own copy of the program and make use of Archer2-specific configurations that have been rigorously tested.

The setup process has been streamlined on Archer2 and can be carried out by following the instructions on the [Archer2 CESM2.1.3 setup](cesm213_setup.md) page

## Using CESM on Archer 2

Information on using CESM2 can be found through the UCAR CESM homepage linked above, and particularly in the  
[CESM 2.1 Quickstart guide](https://escomp.github.io/CESM/versions/cesm2.1/html/).

An Archer2 specific version of the quickstart guide can be found [here](cesm213_run.md)
