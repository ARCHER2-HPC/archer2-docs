# Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 2.1.3

[CESM2](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/) is a fully-coupled, community, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states. It has seven different components: atmosphere, ocean, river run off, sea ice, land ice, waves and adaptive river transport.  At the time of writing, CESM 2.1.3 is the latest scientifically verified version of the model.

## Setting up CESM 2.1.3 on ARCHER2

Due to the nature of CESM2, there is not a centrally installed version of the program available on ARCHER2. Instead, users download their own copy of the program and make use of ARCHER2-specific configurations that have been rigorously tested.

The setup process has been streamlined on ARCHER2 and can be carried out by following the instructions on the [ARCHER2 CESM2.1.3 setup](cesm213_setup.md) page

## Using CESM 2.1.3 on ARCHER2

A [quickstart guide](cesm213_run.md) for running a simple coupled case of CESM 2.1.3 on ARCHER2 can be found here. It should be noted that this is only a quickstart guide with a focus on the way that CESM 2.1.3 should be run specifically on ARCHER2, and is not intended to replace the larger CESM or CIME documentation linked to below.

## Useful Links

If this is your first time running CESM, it is highly recommended that you consult both the [CIME documentation](http://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/maint-5.6/html/) and the [NCAR CESM pages](https://escomp.github.io/CESM/versions/cesm2.1/html/introduction.html) for the version used in CESM 2.1.3, paying particular attention to the pages on [Basic Usage of CIME](http://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/maint-5.6/html/users_guide/index.html) which gives detailed description of the basic commands needed to get a model running.
