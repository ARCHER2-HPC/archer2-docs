# Community Earth System Model (CESM) version 2.1.3

[CESM2](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/) is a fully-coupled, community, global climate model that provides state-of-the-art computer simulations of the Earth's past, present, and future climate states. At the time of writing, CESM 2.1.3 is the latest scientifically verified version of the model.

## Setting up CESM 2.1.3 on ARCHER2

Due to the nature of CESM2, there is not a centrally installed version of the program available on ARCHER2. Instead, users download their own copy of the program and make use of ARCHER2-specific configurations that have been rigorously tested.

The setup process has been streamlined on ARCHER2 and can be carried out by following the instructions on the [ARCHER2 CESM2.1.3 setup](cesm213_setup.md) page

## Using CESM 2.1.3 on ARCHER2

A [quickstart guide](cesm213_run.md) for running a simple coupled case of CESM 2.1.3 on ARCHER2 can be found here. For more detailed instructions, visit the [NCAR CESM pages](https://escomp.github.io/CESM/versions/cesm2.1/html/introduction.html).
