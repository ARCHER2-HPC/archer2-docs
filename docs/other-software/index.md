# Software provided by external parties

This section describes software that has been installed on ARCHER2 by external
parties (i.e. not by the ARCHER2 service itself) for general use by ARCHER2 
users or provides useful notes on software that is not installed centrally.

!!! important
    While the ARCHER2 service desk is able to provide support for basic use of this
    software (e.g. access to software, writing job submission scripts) it does not 
    generally provide detailed technical support for the software and you may be
    directed to seek support from other places if the service desk cannot answer the
    questions.
