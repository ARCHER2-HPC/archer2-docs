# ARCHER2 and publications

This section provides information on how to acknowledge the use of ARCHER2 in your published work and
how to register your work on ARCHER2 into the ARCHER2 publications database via SAFE.

## Acknowledging ARCHER2

We will shortly be publishing a description of the ARCHER2 service with a DOI that you can cite
in your published work that arises from the use of ARCHER2. Until that time, please add the following
words to any work you publish that arises from your use of ARCHER2:

> This work used the ARCHER2 UK National Supercomputing Service (https://www.archer2.ac.uk).

You should also tag outputs with the keyword "ARCHER2" whenever possible.

## ARCHER2 publication database

The ARCHER2 service maintains a publication database of works that have arisen from ARCHER2 and
links them to project IDs that have ARCHER2 access. We ask all users of ARCHER2 to register any
publications in the database - all you need is your publication's DOI.

Registering your publications in SAFE has a number of advantages:

 - For large projects in particular, it allows the project lead to collect publications from all
   the project members to assist with ResearchFish submissions
 - Your publication automatically gets added to the [ARCHER2 publications page](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/research/publications/)
 - Your publication is included in reports to UKRI
 - The better the record we have of publications arising from the ARCHER2 service, the easier it
   is to demonstrate the impacts and benefits of the service; allowing UKRI to secure funding for
   future national supercomputing services.

### How to register a publication in the database

You will need a DOI for the publication you wish to register. A DOI 
has the form of an set of ID strings separated by slashes. For example,
`10.7488/ds/1505`, you should not include the web host address which
provides a link to the DOI.

### How to export your publications

At the moment we support export lists of DOIs to comma-separated values (CSV) files. This
does not export all the metadata, just the DOIs themselves with a maximum of 25 DOIs per line.
This format is primarily useful for importing into ResearchFish (where you can paste in the
comma-separated lists to import publications). We plan to add further export formats in the future.

[Login to SAFE](https://safe.epcc.ed.ac.uk). Then:

1. Go to the Menu *Your details* and select *Publications* 
2. Select the project you wish to list the publications from using the dropdown menu and click *View*.
3. The next page will list your currently registered publications.
4. Click *Export* to generate a plain text comma-separated values (CSV)   file that lists all DOIs.
5. If required, you can save this file using the Save command your web browser.
