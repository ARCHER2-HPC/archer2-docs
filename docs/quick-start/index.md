# Quickstart

The ARCHER2 quickstart guides provide the minimum information for new
users or users transferring from ARCHER. There are two sections
available which are meant to be followed in sequence.

  - [Quickstart for users](quickstart-users.md): Covers the basics of ARCHER2 useful for all
    users, including: applying for an account, logging in and
    transferring data, accessing software and running jobs.
  - [Quickstart for developers](quickstart-developers.md): Covers additional topics around compiling
    your own programs on ARCHER2, debugging and profiling. If you are not going to be compiling your
    own programs on ARCHER2, you do not need to follow this guide.
