Information on each of the centrally-installed Research Software
packages, versions available, how to get access, example job submission
scripts, good practice for getting best performance, links to associated
training and webinars, links to associated technical reports (eCSE final
reports, white papers), links to instruction manuals and further
information.

## Centrally supported packages

ARCHER2 provides a number of research software packages as *centrally
supported packages*. Many of these packages are free to use, but others
require a license (which you, or your research group, need to supply).

The centrally supported package will usually be the current stable
release, to include major releases and significant updates. We will
usually not maintain older versions and versions no longer supported by
the developers of the package.

The following sections provide details on access to each of the
centrally supported packages:

  - [CASTEP](castep/castep.md)
  - [Chemshell](chemshell/chemshell.md)
  - [Code_Saturne](code-saturne/code-saturne.md)
  - [CP2K](cp2k/cp2k.md)
  - [ELK](elk/elk.md)
  - [FHI-aims](fhi-aims/fhi-aims.md)
  - [FEniCS](fenics/fenics.md)
  - [GROMACS](gromacs/gromacs.md)
  - [LAMMPS](lammps/lammps.md)
  - [MITgcm](mitgcm/mitgcm.md)
  - [Met Office Unified Model](mo-unified-model/mo-unified-model.md)
  - [NAMD](namd/namd.md)
  - [Nektar++](nektarplusplus/nektarplusplus.md)
  - [NEMO](nemo/nemo.md)
