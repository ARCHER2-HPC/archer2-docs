# Research Software

ARCHER2 provides a number of research software packages as *centrally
supported packages*. Many of these packages are free to use, but others
require a license (which you, or your research group, need to supply).

This section also contains information on research software contributed
and/or supported by third parties (marked with a * in the list below).

For centrally-supported packages, the version available will usually be
the current stable release, to include major releases and significant
updates. We will usually not maintain older versions and versions no
longer supported by the developers of the package.

The following sections provide details on access to each of the
centrally installed packages (software that is installed or maintained
by third-parties rather than the ARCHER2 service are marked with *):

  - [CASINO(*)](casino.md)
  - [CASTEP](castep.md)
  - [CESM(*)](cesm213.md)
