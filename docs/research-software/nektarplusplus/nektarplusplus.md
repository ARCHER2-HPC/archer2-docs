# NEKTAR++

!!! warning
    The ARCHER2 Service is not yet available. This documentation is in
    development.

Nektar++ is a tensor product based finite element package designed to
allow one to construct efficient classical low polynomial order
<span class="title-ref">h</span>-type solvers (where
<span class="title-ref">h</span> is the size of the finite element) as
well as higher <span class="title-ref">p</span>-order piecewise
polynomial order solvers.

The Nektar++ framework comes with a number of solvers and also allows
one to construct a variety of new solvers. Users can therefore use
Nektar++ just to run simulations, or to extend and/or develop new
functionality.

Nektar++ is released under an MIT license and is available to all users
on ARCHER2.

### Where can I get help?

Specific issues with Nektar++ itself might be submitted to the issue
tracker at the Nektar++ gitlab repository (see link above). More general
questions might also be directed to the Nektar-users mailing list
<https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/nektar-users>. Issues
specific to the use or behaviour of Netkar++ on ARCHER2 should be sent
to the Service Desk.

## Running parallel Nektar++ jobs

!!! note
    We will add information about running Nektar++ and example job submission
    scripts once the software is available.
