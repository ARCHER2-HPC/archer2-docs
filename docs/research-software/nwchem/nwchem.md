# NWChem

!!!warning
   NWChem is currently not working on ARCHER2. We are investigating the
   issues and will release the software on the service once it is
   tested and working.

NWChem aims to provide its users with computational chemistry tools that
are scalable both in their ability to treat large scientific
computational chemistry problems efficiently, and in their use of
available parallel computing resources from high-performance parallel
supercomputers to conventional workstation clusters. The NWChem software
can handle: biomolecules, nanostructures, and solid-state system; from
quantum to classical, and all combinations; Gaussian basis functions or
plane-waves; scaling from one to thousands of processors; properties and
relativity.
