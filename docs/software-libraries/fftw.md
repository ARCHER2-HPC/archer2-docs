# FFTW

  - Provides: FFTW v3
  - Access: `module load cray-fftw`

[FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) is a C subroutine library (which includes
a Fortran interface) for computing the discrete Fourier transform
(DFT) in one or more dimensions, of arbitrary input size, and of
both real and complex data (as well as of even/odd data, i.e. the
discrete cosine/sine transforms or DCT/DST).

Only the version 3 interface is available on ARCHER2.
