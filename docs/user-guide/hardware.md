# ARCHER2 hardware

## System overview

ARCHER2 is a HPE Cray EX supercomputing system with XXX compute nodes. Each compute node has 128 cores ( dual EPYC 7742 64 core 2.25GHz CPUs) with YYYGB RAM. Compute nodes are connected together by a cray slingshot interconnect.

There are additional User Access Nodes (UAN, also called login nodes) which provide access to the system. Compute nodes are only accessible via the SLURM job scheduling system.

There are two file systems: home and work. Home is available only on login nodes. Work is available on login and compute nodes (see [I/O and file systems](io.md)).
