CASTEP
======

.. warning::

  The ARCHER2 Service is not yet available. This documentation is in
  development.

`CASTEP <http://www.castep.org>`__  is a leading code for calculating the
properties of materials from first principles. Using density functional theory,
it can simulate a wide range of properties of materials proprieties including
energetics, structure at the atomic level, vibrational properties, electronic
response properties etc. In particular it has a wide range of spectroscopic
features that link directly to experiment, such as infra-red and Raman
spectroscopies, NMR, and core level spectra.

Using CASTEP on ARCHER2
-----------------------

**CASTEP is only available to users who have a valid CASTEP licence.**

If you have a CASTEP licence and wish to have access to CASTEP on ARCHER2,
please make a request via the SAFE LINK REQUIRED.
Please have your license details to hand.


Running parallel CASTEP jobs
----------------------------

The following script will run a CASTEP job using 2 nodes (256 cores). it
assumes that the input files have the file stem ``text_calc``.

::

  #!/bin/bash

  # Request 2 nodes with 128 MPI tasks per node for 20 minutes
  # Replace [budget code] below with your account code,
  # e.g. '--account=t01'

  #SBATCH --job-name=CASTEP
  #SBATCH --nodes=2
  #SBATCH --tasks-per-node=128
  #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1
  #SBATCH --time=00:20:00
  
  #SBATCH --account=[budget code]

  # Load the CASTEP module, avoid any unintentional OpenMP threading by
  # setting OMP_NUM_THREADS, and launch the code.
  
  module load castep

  # Run without using OpenMP threads
  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
  srun -cpu-bind=cores castep.mpi test_calc
