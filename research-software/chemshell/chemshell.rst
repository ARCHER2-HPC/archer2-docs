ChemShell
=========

.. warning::

  The ARCHER2 Service is not yet available. This documentation is in
  development.


ChemShell is a script-based chemistry code focusing on hybrid QM/MM
calculations with support for standard quantum chemical or force field
calculations. There are two versions: an older Tcl-based version 
Tcl-ChemShell and a more recent python-based version Py-ChemShell.

The advice from https://www.chemshell.org/licence on the difference is:

  We regard Py-ChemShell 19.0 as suitable for production calculations on
  materials systems, although you will find its feature set is more limited
  than Tcl-ChemShell. We do not currently recommend Py-ChemShell for
  calculations on biological systems, as automated import of biomolecular
  force fields is scheduled for a future release.

Using ChemShell on ARCHER2
--------------------------

The python-based version of ChemShell is open-source and is freely
available to all users on ARCHER2.

The older version of Tcl-based ChemShell requires a license. Users
with a valid license should request access via the ARCHER2 SAFE.
