FEniCS is an open-source (LGPLv3) computing platform for solving partial
differential equations (PDEs). FEniCS enables users to translate scientific
models into efficient finite element code. With the high-level Python and
C++ interfaces to FEniCS, it is easy to get started, but FEniCS also offers
powerful capabilities for more experienced programmers.
