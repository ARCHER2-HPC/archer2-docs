The Maasachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm)
is a numerical model designed for study of the atmosphere, ocean, and climate.
MITgcm's flexible non-hydrostatic formulation enables it to simulate fluid
phenomena over a wide range of scales; its adjoint capabilities enable it
to be applied to sensitivity questions and to parameter and state estimation
problems. By employing fluid equation isomorphisms, a single dynamical kernel
can be used to simulate flow of both the atmosphere and ocean.
