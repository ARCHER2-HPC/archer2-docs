NEKTAR++
========

.. warning::

  The ARCHER2 Service is not yet available. This documentation is in
  development.

Nektar++ is a tensor product based finite element package designed to allow
one to construct efficient classical low polynomial order `h`-type solvers
(where `h` is the size of the finite element) as well as higher `p`-order
piecewise polynomial order solvers.

The Nektar++ framework comes with a number of solvers and also allows one to
construct a variety of new solvers. Users can therefore use Nektar++ just to
run simulations, or to extend and/or develop new functionality.
