  The ARCHER2 Service is not yet available. This documentation is in
  development.

NWChem aims to provide its users with computational chemistry tools that are
scalable both in their ability to treat large scientific computational
chemistry problems efficiently, and in their use of available parallel
computing resources from high-performance parallel supercomputers to
conventional workstation clusters. The NWChem software can handle:
biomolecules, nanostructures, and solid-state system; from quantum to
classical, and all combinations; Gaussian basis functions or plane-waves;
scaling from one to thousands of processors; properties and relativity.
