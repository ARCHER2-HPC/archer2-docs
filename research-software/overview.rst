Information on each of the centrally-installed Research Software packages,

good practice for getting best performance, links to associated training
and webinars, links to associated technical reports (eCSE final 
reports, white papers), links to instruction manuals and further information.


Centrally supported packages
----------------------------

ARCHER2 provides a number of research software packages as `centrally
supported packages`. Many of these packages are free to use, but others
require a license (which you, or your research group, need to supply).

The centrally supported package will usually be the current stable release,
to include major releases and significant updates. We will usually not
maintain older versions and versions no longer supported by the developers
of the package.

The following sections provide details on access to each of the centrally
supported packages:
